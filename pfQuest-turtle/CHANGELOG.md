## 1.0.14 — 2026-09-10

- Fixed active quest pins clearing after quest updates until the map filter was changed.
- Improved city and parent-zone pin placement, city visit filtering, and Blackstone Island continent pins.
- Made map rendering safer on clean 1.12 clients and reduced work during map changes on enhanced clients.
- Added an incremental ClassicAPI exploration cache: it warms in the background after login, persists per character, and filters both continents without a full map-open scan.

- Fixed the Turtle corpse-arrow handler continuing after the route arrow was disabled.
- On ClassicAPI clients, nameplate quest icons now use nameplate lifecycle events instead of recurring frame scans.
- Loot panels use ClassicAPI's item-ID icon lookup when available, with the existing client fallback preserved.

## 1.0.12 — 2026-09-09

- Removed expired auto-quest reward guards and completed item-query entries so they do not accumulate during long sessions.

- Improved automatic quest handling: compatible quest-list loading, rapid-click protection, mixed completed/incomplete NPC quest lists, and post-reward pin refresh.
- Includes the existing Turtle QoL modules: continent pins and filters, rare loot panel, corpse arrow, nameplate icons, objective announcements, and party-progress tooltips.

Requires the accompanying patched `pfQuest` base addon. Do not include `db.pre-newdb` in releases; it is a local backup only.
