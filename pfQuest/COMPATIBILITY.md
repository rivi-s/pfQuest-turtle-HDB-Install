# pfQuest setup guide

## What to install

### pfQuest — required

pfQuest is the base addon. It provides:

- Quest markers on the world map and minimap
- Current Zone Only and Hide Unexplored Areas
- Routes and the direction arrow
- Tracker integration
- Kill and item-drop nameplate icons

pfQuest works on a clean 1.12 client.

### pfQuest Turtle — required for Turtle WoW content

Install pfQuest Turtle alongside pfQuest if you play Turtle WoW. It adds:

- Turtle quests, NPCs, objects, items, and custom zones
- Support for Turtle maps such as Blackstone Island and Thalassian Highlands
- Auto-questing: accept, complete, turn in, and collect no-choice rewards
- Optional low-level quest skipping and runecloth-donation automation

pfQuest Turtle also works on a clean 1.12 client.

Without pfQuest Turtle, pfQuest still works, but Turtle-specific quest content and auto-questing are unavailable.

## Optional: ClassicAPI

**ClassicAPI** comes from a compatible modded client. It is optional; both addons work without it.

| Addon | With ClassicAPI | Without ClassicAPI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **pfQuest** | **Hide Unexplored Areas** can read exploration data for maps you have not opened during the session. | Open a zone map once so pfQuest can record its exploration state. |
| **pfQuest Turtle** | An incremental, per-character exploration cache is warmed after login. | The cache is built from maps opened during play. |
| **Both** | City, cave, and continent map placement has extra map context. | Uses built-in map and database fallbacks. |
| **Both** | Quest markers and tracker refresh from direct accept, turn-in, and abandon notices. | They refresh through normal 1.12 quest-log events. |
| **pfQuest Turtle** | **Nameplate icons** update only when a plate appears or disappears, avoiding the repeating world-frame scan. | Nameplate icons use the legacy scan. |
| **Both** | Item-objective icons can be read directly by item ID. | Uses normal icon and tooltip fallbacks. |
| **pfQuest Turtle** | Its loot-panel icons use the direct item-ID lookup. | Uses the normal icon fallback. |
| **pfQuest Turtle** | Uses the enhanced nameplate wrapper when available. | Uses the legacy name-region lookup. |

ClassicAPI makes map filtering and updates more direct. It does not enable a feature that a clean client cannot use. Use `/db api` in game to see whether pfQuest detected it.

## Clean-client notes

The clean client supports markers, routes, Current Zone Only, minimap markers, and kill/drop nameplate icons. The only behavior to keep in mind is **Hide Unexplored Areas**: visit a zone map once before expecting its exploration state to be known.

Hold **Shift** while speaking to an NPC to bypass auto-questing for that interaction.
