# pfQuest base patch notes

## 0.1.0-alpha.11 — 2026-09-24

- Fixed false tracker completion icons while preserving correct readiness for simple talk and hand-in quests.
- Restored route arrows for objective-free hand-ins after asynchronous HearthDB data loads.
- Kept completed quests stable in the Current Zone tracker while opening the Quest Log or selecting another quest.
- Refreshed stale quest markers and objectives without requiring tooltip hover or reload.
- Fixed map objective progress counts and compatibility with UI replacements that do not expose the optional `gfind` global.
- Added Turtle boundary-alias filtering support to the shared zone-map renderer.

## 8.0.31 — 2026-09-19

- Capped the quest-start/quest-end name list in the HDB extended tooltip so a widely shared quest-giver template no longer renders one line wider than the screen.

## 8.0.30 — 2026-09-13

- Kept collapsed Quest Log categories closed when completing quests.

## 8.0.29 — 2026-09-13

- Positioned Level Range directly below All Quests and moved Modern Map Markers controls beneath it when installed.
- Fixed Level Range rendering with pfUI skins while keeping the selector independent of World Map zoom.
- Kept Display Low Level Quest Givers effective when an optional Level Range is selected.
- Renamed the settings action to Save & Close and restored reload prompts for settings that only apply at load time.
- Resolved quests through their canonical database record when a custom server supplies a different quest-link ID.

## 8.0.28 — 2026-09-13

- Cached ClassicAPI map-area data to eliminate continuous World Map allocation churn.

## 8.0.27 — 2026-09-13

- Kept collapsed Quest Log headers and tracker visibility stable through quest progress and completion updates.
- Made Level Range optional and restored normal pfQuest filtering when no range is selected.
- Restored the native Level Range selector appearance on clean clients while retaining pfUI skin support.
- Kept explicit waypoint-addon arrow targets authoritative instead of switching to unrelated quest objectives.

## 8.0.26 — 2026-09-12

- Renamed the World Map filter to Level Range and made All Levels show every available quest.
- Kept minimap objectives, quest starters, and quest enders updating while the World Map is open.

## 8.0.25 — 2026-09-12

- Added live nearest-first and reversible level sorting to the quest tracker.
- Added a World Map filter for available quests by difficulty color.
- Fixed false completed markers after turning in another quest at the same NPC.
- Improved case-insensitive searches, outdoor map selection, and Quest Log map targeting.
- Clarified map controls and allowed pfUI to skin the custom World Map selectors.

## 8.0.24 — 2026-09-11

- Added level-first and nearest-objective sorting controls to the quest tracker.
- Made Ctrl-hide for minimap nodes react immediately in every refresh mode.
- Fixed stale world-map filter labels and zone state after browsing another map.

## 8.0.23 — 2026-09-11

- Added `/db version`, which reports the loaded pfQuest base version and Turtle extension version when installed.

## 8.0.22 — 2026-09-11

- Added Smooth, Balanced, and Performance minimap marker refresh modes. Smooth is now the default and preserves the original responsive movement; the other modes reduce work in dense areas.
- Preserved collapsed Quest Log headers while quest progress updates, so collapsed sections stay closed until the player reopens them.

## 8.0.21 — 2026-09-10

- Reduced map refresh work and fixed active quest pins disappearing after a quest is accepted or availability changes.
- Reduced same-title quest-chain lookup work; clients with optional ClassicAPI use its direct quest-link information while clean clients retain the compatible fallback.
- Refined current-zone and unexplored-area filtering, including city visit tracking and city pins on parent outdoor maps.
- Fixed Blackstone Island continent pin placement and map-pin tooltips.
- Kept direct exploration checks limited to the map currently open, avoiding a continent-map hitch from scanning every zone.
- Added Ctrl-click-through interaction for dense continent pin areas, so ordinary map clicks still open the intended zone.
- Reduced continuous minimap marker work while moving, especially at wide zoom, and kept minimap objective markers visible while browsing another continent.


## 8.0.20 — 2026-09-09

- Added Current Zone Only support for subareas and continent maps.
- Added Hide Quest Pins In Unexplored Areas. Zone-map exploration is cached when a player opens that map; Turtle continent pins use the same cache without changing the viewed map.
- Fixed checkboxes that could remain visibly checked after being disabled.
- Fixed the route-arrow toggle so disabling it immediately stops and hides the arrow.
- Added optional ClassicAPI and HearthDB detection. ClassicAPI clients use direct item-icon lookup and quest lifecycle events.

## 8.0.19 — 2026-09-09

- Kept the configuration layout unchanged while removing full quest resets from ordinary checkbox changes.
- Coalesced map display refreshes, applied tracker and route settings directly, and deferred quest-giver rebuilds.
- Replaced the reloading Save & Close action with Close; settings remain saved as they are changed.

## 8.0.18 — 2026-09-09

- Restored automatic quest-tracker visibility after login and reload.
- Reduced idle quest-log polling from once per second to a one-minute fallback; normal quest events still refresh immediately.
- Reduced quest-arrow allocation by updating its visual state at the route update rate instead of every rendered frame.
- Made the Quest Log Translate label blue before a language is selected.

## 8.0.17 — 2026-09-09

- Fixed periodic FPS hitches caused by the collapsed quest-section tracker update.
- The tracker now refreshes collapsed sections only when the quest log changes.

## 8.0.16 — 2026-09-08

- Quest tracker now hides quests in collapsed quest-log sections and restores them when expanded.
- Collapsed sections do not remove active quest data or map markers.

## 8.0.15 — 2026-09-08

- Fixed Quest Log controls on clients with incompatible HookScript implementations.
- Quest browser links now contain the actual quest ID.
- Unresolved quest links are inserted as plain text instead of invalid Quest 0 links.

## 2026-09-07

- Made Russian quest text selectable on English Turtle clients through pfQuest's existing Quest Log translation menu.
- Retains only the Russian quest-text table; foreign item and NPC databases remain unloaded to limit memory use.

## 2026-09-07

- Fixed Russian client support: the release now loads the base Russian database before the Turtle Russian overlay.

## 2026-09-07

- Fixed Current Zone Only missing objective pins after quest acceptance; the active quest map data now receives one deferred refresh after Turtle's quest-log updates settle.
- Added merged-spawn support so creatures sharing an exact quest-item spawn can each resolve the matching tooltip without duplicating map pins.

## 2026-09-06

- Fixed High Elf and Goblin race-specific starter quest markers.
- Avoided a native quest-log selection path for uniquely named quests, improving compatibility with older hooked clients.

## 2026-09-04

- Fixed a continent/world-map refresh error caused by attempting to index a missing zone map.
- Fixed tracker entries overlapping after quest-log objective updates.
- Fixed the tracker title index becoming stale after sorting, which could cause automatic updates to affect the wrong entry.

This is the required base-addon companion for the matching `pfQuest-turtle` release.
